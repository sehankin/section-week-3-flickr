# SI 507 Fall 2017 - Section Week 3

### Flickr API
- `sample_diction.json` contains the Flickr API response
- We will create a class Photo, that takes a nested dictionary, and saves interesting properties and values of the API response as object variables

#### Coding Activity — Learning by doing (~30 mins):

> Reference: https://www.programsinformationpeople.org/runestone/static/publicpy3/Classes/ClassesHoldingData.html

- [x] Discuss in pairs (5 mins): *What is interesting in the response?*
- [x] Create a file `flickr_response.py`
- [x] Create a `class Photo`
    - Through its constructor, save the values of interesting properties from the Flickr API response into its object variables.
    - This step is called *initializing* the object with values.
- [x] Write `__str__` method for this class
    - What would be an interesting string?
- [x] Write `__repr__` method
    - What technical details are interesting when you debug the code?
- [x] Write `__contains__` method
    - What are a few things that are interesting to check for using the `in` operator?
    - Think about the condition `if "______" in photo: do something`
- [x] Commit and push to your forked repository

### Project 2 — Manage your project through Github (~20 mins)
- [ ] Fork: https://github.com/SI507-F17/507-Project2-F17
- [ ] Look at the code file and discuss in pairs what you understood (5 mins)
- [ ] Create Milestones and set deadlines for yourself for each milestone
- [ ] Create Issues (they are like broad ToDos) and tag it against each Milestones
    - [ ] Create a checklist in the description of each Issue, just like how you would divide a big task into smaller, manageable tasks.
- [ ] Submit the link of your forked repository on your section's discussion thread in Canvas
- [ ] Work on creating new Issues and checklists in issue descriptions for Project 2 at home. This will help you keep track of your progress and ensure that you don't miss out anything in your submission.
